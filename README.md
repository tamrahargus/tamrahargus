# Tamra Hargus  
**SoC Physical Design & IC Layout Engineer**

I focus on delivering physical design and layout that are reliable and reproducible.  
I document what I learn, share study guides, and write about the challenges of SoC physical design and IC layout.  

Specializing in **Analog Hard IPs (HIPs)**, **Custom & Compiler-Generated Memory Macros**, and **Standard Cell Library Development**.  
Skilled in STA, P&R, DRC/LVS, and automation scripting to deliver advanced-node designs that meet stringent PPA, reliability, and manufacturing targets.

## Background
Over the course of my career, I’ve taken SoC partitions, Analog Hard IPs, and both custom and compiler-generated memory macros from concept to tapeout.  
I’ve also designed and implemented multiple standard cell libraries, ensuring every block meets performance, power, area, and manufacturability requirements.  
My focus has been on building layouts that balance precision and efficiency, while keeping flows reproducible and sign-off ready.
